- For both individual months the mean and median are very close. Additionally, the IQR is only 4 for June and 5 for December.
- June's maximum is only 2 degrees warmer than December's max, but the minimum for June is 8 degrees warmer than December's min.
- Even though June has 1 less day than December, there are 183 more dates in June than there are in December.


## Summary
The June data has quality weather for surfing and eating icecream, with a max of just 85 and over 75% of the days being over 73 degrees. December's average temperature is great for surfing, but is apporaching too cold for icecream. With 1 out of 4 days being 69 degrees or less, I think business could withstand the few slow days.

Additional research is needed to determine the viability, including how many days are sunny without rain for each month. Also what is the average wind speed for each month. Of course this depends on people's tolerance for temperature, amount of rain, and wind speed. So, I would commission a survey team to ask the locals and frequent visitors what their thresholds are, possibly in exchange for a coupon when the shop opens!
